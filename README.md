<h2 style="font-size:300%;font-weight:bold">DEPRECATED</h2>

I don't think anyone is actually using this, but just in case: if you need a common Clojure/ClojureScript API for random number generation, you should use the splittable PRNG implemented for [test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) (`clojure.test.check.random`). I implemented pprng solely to enable [double-check](https://github.com/cemerick/double-check), and its deprecation leaves this project without purpose.

--------

portable pseudo-random number generators for Clojure/ClojureScript

## "Installation"

Add to your [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) `project.clj`:

```clojure
[com.cemerick/pprng "0.0.3"]
```

## Usage

**NOTE** pprng does not use cryptographically-secure random number generators,
either on Clojure/JVM or ClojureScript/JS.  _**DO NOT**_ use this library to
help implement or inform any cryptographically-sensitive algorithm.

```clojure
user=> (require '[cemerick.pprng :as rng])
nil
;; get a new RNG, optionally providing a seed
user=> (def rng (rng/rng))
#'user/rng
;; obtain values from it...
user=> (rng/int rng)
-1170105035
user=> (rng/int rng 1000)
267
user=> (rng/boolean rng)
false
user=> (rng/double rng)
0.6832234717598454
;; obtain the seed that was used to create it originally, if necessary
user=> (rng/seed rng)
1372270869019
```
